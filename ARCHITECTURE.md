# ColumbiaPA300 - System Architecture

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

ColumbiaPA300 was built as a **civic engagement platform** for the Borough of Columbiaâ€™s 300th Anniversary.  
It provided residents and students with an **end-to-end digital hub** for:

- Logo submissions (100+ entries)
- Community voting (18-round contest, ~150 participants)
- Donations (~$1,500 total raised)
- Media uploads (photos/videos)
- Civic storytelling (timeline, history, event pages)

---

## ðŸ›  Core Architecture Overview

The system was designed as a **serverless application** deployed on Netlify with **React frontend + Netlify Functions backend**.

### ðŸ”¹ Frontend (React + Vite)
- React 19 + Vite 6.3
- `react-router-dom` for page navigation
- Public pages:
  - `/` â†’ Home
  - `/vote` â†’ Community voting
  - `/media` â†’ Media uploads
  - `/donate` â†’ Stripe donations
  - `/contact` â†’ Contact form
  - `/thank-you` â†’ Donation confirmation
  - `/privacy` â†’ Privacy policy
  - 404 fallback
- Styled with per-page CSS modules (to be migrated to Tailwind in Milestone 2)

---

### ðŸ”¹ Backend (Netlify Functions)
Serverless functions handle interactivity, persistence, and integrations:

- `create-checkout-session.js` â†’ Stripe donations (recurring + one-time)
- `submit-vote.js` â†’ Vote submission & validation (Airtable persistence)
- `submitForm.js` â†’ Student logo submissions (Airtable + Google Drive + Slack alert)
- `mediaUpload.js` â†’ Media uploads (direct binary transfer â†’ Drive)
- `createResumableUpload.js` â†’ Large-file resumable uploads (Drive)
- `notifySlackResumable.js` â†’ Slack notifications for large file uploads

---

### ðŸ”¹ Data & Storage
- **Airtable** â†’ Votes + student logo submissions
- **Google Drive** â†’ File storage for logos & media uploads
- **Stripe** â†’ Donation handling (Checkout sessions)
- **Slack Webhooks** â†’ Real-time alerts for submissions and uploads
